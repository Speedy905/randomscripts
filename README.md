# randomscripts
These are scripts that I would use on my Linux System (or sometimes Windows if possible).
These scripts are usually just a one time upload for archival/sharing purposes.
These were uploaded here because I felt like these scripts didn't really need their own personal repo,
hence why this repo allows me to freely upload them here. 

Feel free to use these scripts under the MIT [license](LICENSE).

immediateshutdown.sh
--------------------

This script allows me to shutdown my laptop/computer immeadiately without any waiting for programs
to close.

immediaterestart.shhttps://www.google.ca/
--------------------

Similar to [immediateshutdown](immediateshutdown.sh), it does the same thing excepts it restarts instead
of shutting down.

infiniteloop.py
--------------

This just prints an infinite loop of "Hello World." This means no purpose, but just for fun.

pitemp.sh
---------

This checks the temps of my raspberry pi 3.


discordbot_test.py
------------------

This is just testing of my own discord bot, getting to know how it works. 


update.sh
---------

A one-click/command for me to update [Kamikaze94's WolfHud](https://github.com/Kamikaze94/WolfHUD) easily and quickly.


volumenotify.sh
---------------

A notification script that allows me to view the current volume on my laptop.
(Note: Since I switched to the XFCE DE, I have no need for this script anymore, although this can be used for DE that use
the OpenBox Window Manager (i.e LXDE))

systemupdate.sh
---------------

A script paired with crontab that updates my system every 1st day of the month. (I could have just listed the command while in crontab -e
but I wanted to customize of how I would update the system)

google-drive-sync.sh
--------------------

A script thats uses the grive command from [vitalif's grive2](https://github.com/vitalif/grive2) to sync my google drive in one command. (Aka using alias)

thunderbirdstart.sh
-------------------

An Autostart script that delays the startup of thunderbird so that internet connectivity can be established.
