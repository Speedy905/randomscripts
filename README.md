# randomscripts
These are scripts that I would use on my Linux System (or sometimes Windows if possible).
These scripts are usually just a one time upload for archival/sharing purposes.
These were uploaded here because I felt like these scripts didn't really need their own personal repo,
hence why this repo allows me to freely upload them here. 

Feel free to use these scripts under the MIT [license](LICENSE).

immediateshutdown.sh
--------------------

This script allows me to shutdown my laptop/computer immeadiately without any waiting for programs
to close.

immediaterestarat.sh
--------------------

Similar to [immediateshutdown](immediateshutdown.sh), it does the same thing excepts it restarts instead
of shutting down.

infiniteloop.py
--------------

This just prints an infinite loop of "Hello World." This means no purpose, but just for fun.
